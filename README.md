# TypeScript-Product-Review-Web-Page

This project is a simple product review web page for a Nintendo Gameboy written in TypeScript, HTML, and CSS. The page features a review average, product description, review entry section, and list of reviews. Each time a review is added it is appended to the end of the review list and the rating is included in the average at the top of the page.

The tsconfig.json file is used to configure the compilation of the TypeScript code to JavaScript. Here, the output directory ("outDir") is defined to the dist folder, which is where the JavaScript code can be found.

I create this project during my undergrad at UNF in my Web Frameworks course.
